**GRAIN PALETTE: A DEEP LEARNING ODYSSEY IN RICE TYPE CLASSIFICATION THROUGH TRANSFER LEARNING
**

INTRODUCTION

Rice is most widely consumed staple foods worldwide, with different varieties and specific characteristics such as shape, size, texture.
In this study, we explore the potential of deep learning and transfer learning techniques to automate the classification of rice grains with accuracy. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we aim to develop an optimized model that can distinguish between different rice varieties based on their structural features.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Rice is a staple food with different varities, and which have unique characteristics like shape, size, and texture. Manually identifying and classifying these varieties is slow, requires expertise, and can lead to errors.
This project is build to use deep learning to create a smart system that can automatically identify and classify different types of rice from images.

There are some challenges in classifying rice varities on the basis of their characteristics:

i) Some rice varieties look very similar, making classification difficult.

ii) It takes more time to collect and label a large number of rice images.

iii) The model may not work well under different lighting conditions and image variations due to lack of input dataset.



OBJECTIVES

Here are some objectives of this project:

a. To build a deep learning based rice classification system that can classify and identify rice varities.

b. To analyze and compare different pre-trained models for feature extraction and classification accuracy

c. To validate the modelâ€™s performance on a diverse dataset containing multiple rice varieties.

METHODOLOGY

i) Collect a dataset containing images of different rice varieties like basmati, Jasmine, Arborio,etc.

ii) Use pre-trained CNN architectures for feature extraction.

iii) Fine-tune the selected model on the rice classification dataset.

iv) Train the model using some optimizers like Adam, SGD.

v) Use standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

vi) Develop a user-friendly interface for real time rice classification.
